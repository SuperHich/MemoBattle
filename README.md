    *   **Medium:** A balanced grid size (4x4) for a moderate challenge.
    *   **Hard:** A larger grid (6x4) for a true test of memory.

## How to Play

1.  **Start the Game:** Launch the Memo Battle app.
2.  **Select Difficulty:** Choose your desired challenge level (Easy, Medium, or Hard).
3.  **Single Player vs. Two Player:**
    *   For a single-player game, simply start playing.
    *   For a two-player game, the game automatically starts in two-player mode with turn-based gameplay.
4.  **Flip Cards:** Tap on any two cards to flip them over.
5.  **Find Matches:** If the two flipped cards have the same icon, they are a match and will remain face up.
6.  **Mismatches:** If the cards do not match, they will automatically flip back over after a short delay.
7.  **Two-Player Turns:** In two-player mode, after a mismatch, the turn switches to the other player. If a match is found, the current player gets another turn.
8.  **Game End:** The game ends when all pairs have been matched.
9.  **Winning:** In two-player mode, the player with the highest score (most matched pairs) wins. In case of a tie, it's a draw!
